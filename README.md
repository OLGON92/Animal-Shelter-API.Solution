## üåê About the Project

### üìñ Description
_This is an API that works as a way to create profiles for animals in an imaginary shelter. It has full CRUD capability, meaning that you can look at a list of animals, look for a specific animal, add an animal profile, edit an animal profile, and delete an animal profile. It utilizes versioning, and pagination. Each profile includes a name, species, description, age, and the date the profile was made. This is my thirteenth Epicodus project that is meant to show my knowledge of making an API using C#. Here is a [link](https://github.com/OLGON92/Animal-Shelter-API.Solution) to the repository._

#### Install Postman
* _(Optional) [Download and install Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)._

#### Code Editor
You will need a code editor to view or edit the code. My favorite, and recommended one is Visual Studio Code.
* _Click this [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)_
* _Choose the the most applicable file to download for your OS_
* _Once downloaded, open the download to complete the setup_

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Use

  #### Cloning & Downloading
  * _Go to the repository here [link](https://github.com/OLGON92/Animal-Shelter-API.Solution)_
  * _Click "Clone or download" to reveal the HTTPS url ending with .git and the 'Download ZIP' option_
  * _Open up your system Terminal or GitBash, navigate to your desktop with the command: `cd Desktop`, or whichever location suits you best_
  * _Clone the repository to your desktop using: `git clone https://github.com/OLGON92/Animal-Shelter-API.Solution.git`_
  * _Enter the command `cd Animal-Shelter-API.Solution` to reach the project directory_
  * _Enter `code .` to open it up in Visual Studio Code_
  * _Alternatively you can just download it by clicking on "Download Zip" option from before_

  #### AppSettings
  * _Navigate to the 'Animal-Shelter-API.Solution' directory on your computer_
  * _Open it with `code .` and watch as it opens with Visual Studio Code_
  * _From here you will go to the "AnimalShelterApi" Directory_
  * _Create a new file called "appsettings.json"_
  * _In the appsettings.json file you will add the following code below_
  * _*Please note that your username and password is dependent on what you have set up in your MySQLWorkbench.*_
  * _*Also, do not include the brackets []*_
  ```
  {
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=animal_shelter_api;uid=[YourUserNameHere];pwd=[YourPasswordHere];"
    }
  }
  ```
  #### Database
  * _Navigate to 'Animal-Shelter-API.Solution' in your command line_
  * _From there navigate to 'AnimalShelterApi'_
  * _Run the command "dotnet build"_
   _Now you will need to create a migration; run the command "dotnet ef migrations add Initial"_
  * _Anytime you make a change to any of the models, you will have to enter this command "dotnet ef migrations add [ChangeInMigration]" . Please note that the brackets don't need to be there, and words in brackets are an example._
  * _After verifying that the changes are correct enter "dotnet ef database update". If you would like to remove a migration, enter "dotnet ef migrations remove"_
  * _Then run the command "dotnet watch run"_
  * _It should then open the development environment in your preferred web browser automatically_

  #### Launch the API
  * _Navigate to 'Animal-Shelter-API.Solution' in your command line_
  * _From there navigate to 'AnimalShelterApi'_
  * _Run the command `dotnet run` to have access to the API in Postman or browser_
------------------------------

## üõ∞Ô∏è API Documentation
Explore the API endpoints in Postman or a browser.

### Using Swagger Documentation
* _After entering `dotnet run` in the 'AnimalShelterApi' you will then open your web browser_
* _Type this 'https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html' in the browser or 'http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html'

### Note on Versioning
* _There are two different version of this API_
* _If you are using swagger you can click on the top right rectangle that has a 'v1' to switch between the two versions_
* _If you are using Postman you will need to specify which version you are using in the URL_
* _Here are two examples 'https://localhost:5001/api/v1/Animals' and 'https://localhost:5001/api/v2/Animals'_

### Note on Pagination
* _Version 2 is the ONLY version that utilizes pagination_
* _By default it will show you 5 results per page_
* _You can navigate to page two by modifying the page number in the URL_
* _Here's an example 'https://localhost:5001/api/v2/Animals?pageNumber=1&pageSize=5'_
* _To see the default enter the URL like this 'https://localhost:5001/api/v2/Animals'_

### Endpoints
These are base URL's:
Base URL: `https://localhost:5000` or `https://localhost:5001`

#### HTTP Request Structure
This is the http request structure.
* Please note that this request structure is for API's that use versioning. For an API that doesn't use versioning you would make it look more like this '/api/{component}'
```
GET /api/{version}/{component}
POST /api/{version}/{component}
GET /api/{version}/{component}/{id}
PUT /api/{version}/{component}/{id}
DELETE /api/{version}/{component}/{id}
```

#### Example Query
```
https://localhost:5001/api/v2/Animals/2
```
#### Sample JSON Response
```
{
  "animalId": 2,
  "name": "Kobe",
  "species": "Dog",
  "description": "Small dog with short, black, brown, and orange fur.",
  "age": 12,
  "dateAdded": "2023-02-12T00:01:37.756"
}

```
..........................................................................................
### Animals
Here I will show you how to utilize GET for all animals, POST, GET for a specific animal, PUT, and DELETE
* Please note that when you 
#### HTTP Request
```
GET /api/v1/animals
POST /api/v1/animals
GET /api/v1/animals/{id}
PUT /api/v1/animals/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/animals/{id}
```

#### Example Query
